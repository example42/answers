## Puppet slides

Slides are based on reveal.js and contain screencasts made with asciinema.

You need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first.

Setup on Linux and Mac:

    cd puppet
    npm install
    npm start

Setup on Windows:

    cd puppet
    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm rebuild node-sass
    npm start

Then browse to: http://localhost:8000/
